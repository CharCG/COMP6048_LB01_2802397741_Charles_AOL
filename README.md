# Boogle – Slang Dictionary CLI

*This project is conducted as a requirement for the completion of the Data Structures (COMP6048) course as an Assurance of Learning (AOL) assessment.*

## Project Overview

Boogle is a command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C, designed as a dictionary for contemporary slang terminology. It enables users to add, search, and display slang terms along with their corresponding definitions. The core of the application is built upon a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure, which ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and prefix-based querying of slang words and their descriptions.

## Features

* Release a New Slang – Add new slang words and their descriptions to the dictionary.
* Search a Slang Word – Look up a specific slang word to view its definition.
* View by Prefix – Display all slang words in the dictionary that start with a user-specified prefix.
* View All – Display every slang word currently stored in the dictionary.
